# Introduction
Technology is a never ending process.To be able to design a product using the current technology that will be beneficial to the lives of others is a huge contribution to the community.

* Actuators may be light switches, motors, or motorized valves that control the actual mechanism, or function, of a home automation system. They are programmed to be activated by a remote command from a controller.
