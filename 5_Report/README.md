# Abstract
Automation is one of the applications of control systems and information technologies to cut back the necessary works for humans in the assembly of products and services. In the field of industrialization, automation could be a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provided human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular necessities of work. In addition, automation greatly decreases the necessity for human sensory and mental requirements. The use of automation is increasing day by day in daily experiences and in the world economy. The idea of home automation has been a crucial issue in several publications and residential appliances corporations. Home automation could be a house or living setting that contains the technology to permit devices and systems to be controlled mechanically. Remote and native management is helpful to stay home snug and to support either older or disabled individuals. Hereby, the most effective and easiest method to automate the home appliances are discussed in this work
# Requirements
# Introduction
Technology is a never ending process.To be able to design a product using the current technology that will be beneficial to the lives of others is a huge contribution to the community. The idea of "Home Automation" has been existed for several years.The terms "Smart Home", "Intelligent Home" followed and has been used to introduce the concept of networking appliances and devices in the house.Thus the concept of smart home has focused the attention of researchers,lifestyle practitioners,and the customers to be directed forward the usage of the recent technology.

# Objective
The basic aim of Home automation is to control or monitor signals from different appliances, or basic services. A smart phone or web browser can be used to control or monitor the home automation system.

# Features
There are three main elements of a home automation system: sensors, controllers, and actuators. Sensors can monitor changes in daylight, temperature, or motion detection. Home automation systems can then adjust those settings (and more) to your preferences.

* Sensors can monitor changes in daylight, temperature, or motion detection. Home automation systems can then adjust those settings (and more) to your preferences.
* Controllers refer to the devices — personal computers, tablets or smartphones — used to send and receive messages about the status of automated features in your home.
* Actuators may be light switches, motors, or motorized valves that control the actual mechanism, or function, of a home automation system. They are programmed to be activated by a remote command from a controller.
